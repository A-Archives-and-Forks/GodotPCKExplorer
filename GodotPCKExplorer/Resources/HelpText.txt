Godot can embed '.pck' files into other files.
Therefore, GodotPCKExplorer can open both '.pck' and files with embedded 'pck'.
Encryption is only verified with PCK for Godot 4.
"" - Paths and other arguments must be without spaces or inside quotes.
{} - Optional arguments

Examples of valid commands:
-o	Open pack file
	-o [path to pack] {[encryption key]}
	-o C:/Game.exe
	-o C:/Game.pck

-i	Show pack file info
	-i [path to pack]
	-i C:/Game.exe
	-i C:/Game.pck
	
-l	Show pack file info with a list of packed files
	-l [path to pack] {[encryption key]}
	-l C:/Game.exe
	-l C:/Game.pck

-e	Extract content from a pack to a folder. Automatically overwrites existing files
	-e [path to pack] [path to output folder] {[encryption key]}
	-e C:/Game.exe "C:/Path with Spaces"
	-e C:/Game.pck Output_dir

-es	Export like -e but skip existing files

-p	Pack content of folder into .pck file
	The version should be in this format: PACK_VERSION.GODOT_MINOR._MAJOR._PATCH
	-p [path to folder] [output pack file] [version] {[alignment]} {[encryption key]}
	-p "C:/Directory with files" C:/Game_New.pck 1.3.2.0
	-p "C:/Directory with files" C:/Game_New.pck 2.4.0.1 16 

-pe	Pack embedded. Equal to just -p, but embed '.pck' into target file
	-p [path to folder] [exe to pack into] [version] {[alignment]} {[encryption key]}
	-p "C:/Directory with files" C:/Game.exe 1.3.2.0
	-p "C:/Directory with files" C:/Game.exe 2.4.0.0 32

-m	Merge pack into target file. So you can copy the '.pck' from one file to another
	-m [path to pack] [file to merge into]
	-m C:/Game.pck C:/Game.exe
	-m C:/GameEmbedded.exe C:/Game.exe

-r	Rip '.pck' from file
	If the output file is not specified, it will just be deleted from the original file
	Otherwise, it will be extracted without changing the original file
	-r [path to file] {[output pack file]}
	-r C:/Game.exe C:/Game.pck
	-r C:/Game.exe

-s	Split file with embedded '.pck' into two separated files
	-s [path to file] {[path to the new file (this name will also be used for '.pck')]}
	-s C:/Game.exe "C:/Out Folder/NewGameSplitted.exe"
	-s C:/Game.exe

-c	Change version of the '.pck'
	-c [path to pck] [new version]
	-c C:/Game.pck 1.3.4.1
	-c C:/Game.exe 2.4.0.2
